| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2         | **Hostile:** The target is openly hostile. They may attack if possible, or otherwise betray, report on, or hinder the party at the first opportunity. They don't help without an overwhelming reward or threat of some kind. |
| 3         | **Unfriendly:** The character isn't interested in helping unless they have little choice and/or is offered a substantial payment or reward.                                                                                  |
| 4-5       | **Uncooperative:** The target isn't interested in getting involved unless there's a significant advantage to themselves.                                                                                                     |
| 6-8       | **Neutral:** The character has no particular attitude toward the group. They expect fair payment for any sort of favor or information.                                                                                       |
| 9-10      | **Cooperative:** The character is generally sympathetic. They help if they can for a small fee, favor, or kindness.                                                                                                          |
| 11        | **Friendly:** The individual goes out of their way for the hero. They likely do simple tasks for very little, and are willing to do more dangerous tasks for fair pay or other favors.                                       |
| 12        | **Helpful:** The target is anxious to help the hero and probably does so for little or no reward.                                                                                                                            |
