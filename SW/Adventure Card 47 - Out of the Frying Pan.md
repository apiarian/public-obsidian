Summary:: The party gets out the current trouble but may end up in a different dangerous situation or incur some other cost.

Play to get the party out of some troublesome or deadly incident.

This leads to some other trouble, however, such as capture, escape to a new location with its own harrowing adventure, or the sacrifice of a noble ally.
